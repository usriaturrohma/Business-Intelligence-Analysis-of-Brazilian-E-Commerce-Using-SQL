## üìÇ **Project Overview**

### Background

Evaluating e-commerce performance is crucial to understand both market concentration and business sustainability. This project explores the **Brazilian e-commerce market** through SQL-based analysis to assess customers, sellers, and product categories.

### Project Goals

This project aims to derive actionable insights through SQL analysis with a focus on three main dimensions:

1. **Customer Distribution & Retention**

   * Analyze customer concentration across states.
   * Compare one-time vs repeat buyers and spending concentration (top spenders).
   * Identify retention challenges and highlight loyalty opportunities.

2. **Seller Performance**

   * Evaluate revenue distribution among sellers.
   * Assess performance based on review scores and order volume.
   * Uncover seller concentration in specific regions, especially S√£o Paulo.

3. **Product Category Insights**

   * Identify top-selling product categories.
   * Detect problematic categories with high demand but poor ratings.
   * Provide insights on category trends and product quality implications.

## üìÇ **Data Preparation**

The dataset is sourced from the **Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist (Kaggle)**.

Steps performed:

1. Created a PostgreSQL database and defined schemas using `CREATE TABLE`.
2. Imported datasets into tables (`customers`, `orders`, `sellers`, `products`, `reviews`, `payments`, `items`, `geolocation`).
3. Added primary and foreign key constraints to establish table relationships.
4. Generated the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for visualization.

## üìÇ **Data Analysis**

### Customer Distribution & Retention

<details>
  <summary>Click to view SQL Queries</summary>

```sql

```

</details>

**Key findings:** 
* Customer distribution is highly concentrated; S√£o Paulo clearly dominates.
* A small set of states (S√£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais) lead, while the rest form a long tail with modest contributions.
* The pattern reflects regional concentration of demand and uneven penetration across states.
![Distribution of Unique Customers by State](assets/Output%201.png)

**Key findings:** 
* Customer mix is skewed toward first-time buyers; repeat purchasing is limited.
* Retention underperforms, suggesting growth relies more on acquisition than loyalty.
* Priority: drive second purchases and loyalty initiatives to raise lifetime value and improve acquisition payback.
![Output 2](assets/Output%202.png)

**Key Findings:**
* Highly concentrated spending: The top customer spends significantly more than others, with the highest spender contributing the majority of the total spend.
* Top 10 customers dominate: The top 10 customers account for a substantial portion of the overall spending, indicating a small number of customers are driving revenue.
* Significant spending disparity: There is a sharp drop-off in total spending after the top spender, highlighting the unequal distribution of spending among customers.
![Output 3](assets/Output%203.png)

### Seller Performance

**Key findings:**
* Top 2 sellers dominate: The top 2 sellers contribute the majority of the total revenue, with the highest seller generating over $249,640.
* Skewed revenue distribution: A few sellers generate significantly more revenue compared to others, indicating that revenue is not evenly distributed.
* Seller performance variability: Despite the top sellers driving revenue, there is significant variation in revenue between the remaining sellers, with the bottom sellers contributing much less.
![Output 4](assets/Output%204.png)

**Key findings:**
* S√£o Paulo dominates with a seller count far above all other provinces, highlighting a strong concentration of sellers in one region.
* Sharp drop-off after S√£o Paulo, with the next provinces (Paran√°, Minas Gerais, Santa Catarina, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul) contributing significantly fewer sellers but still forming the second tier of activity.
* Long tail distribution: Most other provinces host very few sellers (many with fewer than 10), showing a highly uneven geographic distribution of seller presence.
![Output 5](assets/Output%205.png)

**Key findings:**
* Several sellers achieved perfect or near-perfect review scores (‚âà5.0), even with a substantial number of completed orders.
* The top seller not only maintained a 5.0 rating but also had the highest order volume (33 orders), showing consistent customer satisfaction.
* Overall, sellers with sufficient transaction volume demonstrated very high review averages, indicating strong service quality and positive customer experiences. 
![Output 6](assets/Output%206.png)

### Product Category Insights

**Key findings:**
* Beleza_saude leads as the top-selling category with over 36.6M in total sales, well ahead of other categories.
* Esporte_lazer and relogios_presentes follow, contributing more than 30M and 24.6M respectively, showing strong consumer demand.
* The distribution highlights a clear dominance of lifestyle and household-related categories (beauty, sports, home, and electronics accessories) in driving overall sales.
![Output 7](assets/Output%207.png)

**Key findings:**
* Several product categories (e.g., beleza_saude, utilidades_domesticas) received very low ratings (‚âà1.0‚Äì2.0) yet still had relatively high order volumes.
* This pattern indicates potential problem products: despite high demand, customers consistently gave poor reviews.
* Such categories may reflect quality issues, mismatch with expectations, or service-related problems, making them priority areas for investigation and improvement.

## üìä **Business Insights Summary**

### üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Customer Distribution & Retention

Customer presence is highly concentrated:
* S√£o Paulo leads by a wide margin, followed by Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais, while most other states contribute modestly.
* The customer mix is skewed toward one-time buyers (~97%), with repeat purchases very limited.
* Spending is also concentrated: the top 10 customers account for a substantial share, with the top spender far exceeding the rest.
This suggests low retention and heavy reliance on acquisition, highlighting the need for:
* Loyalty and re-engagement programs
* Incentives for second purchases
* Personalized campaigns for high-value customers

### üè™ Seller Performance

Seller activity also shows strong concentration:
* The top 2 sellers dominate revenue, each exceeding $200K+, while the rest contribute less.
* S√£o Paulo hosts the majority of sellers, with other provinces forming a long tail of limited presence.
* Some sellers achieved near-perfect review scores (‚âà5.0) while handling high order volumes, indicating strong and consistent service quality.
This emphasizes opportunities to:
* Support mid- and lower-tier sellers to boost competitiveness
* Replicate best practices from high-rated, high-volume sellers

### üõí Product Category Insights

Product sales are driven by lifestyle and household-related categories:
* Beleza_saude leads with over 36.6M in sales, followed by esporte_lazer and relogios_presentes.
* However, some categories (e.g., beleza_saude, utilidades_domesticas) show high demand but low ratings (‚â§2), signaling possible quality or expectation gaps.
This calls for:
* Deeper quality and fulfillment checks on popular categories
* Prioritization of customer feedback loops for problematic products
* Continuous monitoring of product category trends

---

## üìÇ **Business Implications**

* Strengthen customer retention by introducing loyalty programs, personalized promotions, and post-purchase engagement to convert one-time buyers into repeat customers and improve CLV relative to CAC.
* Mitigate revenue dependency on top sellers by expanding seller development programs, recruiting in underrepresented regions outside S√£o Paulo, and sharing best practices from high-performing sellers to elevate overall service quality.
* Address product quality gaps by closely monitoring categories with high demand but low ratings, such as beleza_saude and utilidades_domesticas, and implementing stronger quality assurance and customer feedback mechanisms to ensure satisfaction and reduce churn.
